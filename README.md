# Dijkstra-s-Shortest-Path-Algorithm
Solving travelling salesman problem without the help of computer can be very challenging. On top of 
that, implementing Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm even on a simple figure or graph can also be 
confusing. A computerised program to solve travelling salesman problem by using Dijkstra’s Shortest 
Path Algorithm is in need to be developed. The objectives of this project are to understand the use 
of Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, to solve the travelling salesman problem (TSP) using python,
to display the shortest distance travelled using Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, and to list all
possib;e paths from a city to another city.
